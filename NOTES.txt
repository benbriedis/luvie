MIDI monitoring: use gmidimonitor  (in Ubuntu repo)


- change the URLs to my Github account


Tools
-----
lv2lint    to check plugin
valgrind   for memory issues

ninja!	Try this to speed up builds


Plugin structures
-----------------
1. Monolithic, but with internal API
   PRO can share the graphics library
   PRO gui can easily be split into tabs etc
   PRO dont have multiple plugins appear in Ardour that are somehow loosely connected

2. Both an LV2 host and client.
   Clients have extensions... eg option/requirement to share the host GUI.
   Probably have some 'built in' plugins.
   PRO child plugins could possibly be run separately if desired.
   PRO allows for separate development of parts.
   PRO other plugins could perhaps be run with constraints. 
       eg play one pattern per instance, bring their own GUIs.
	   We probably control their transport.
	   This is could a type 'trigger' situation. Still a place for a MIDI trigger plugin.
        

3. The Song editor is a 'peer' plugin
   Extensions required for discovery between plugins and maybe saving data.
   PRO maybe easier...
   CON probably liable to be confusing at the end of the day.

Alternatives to using JSON for storage

Libraries
---------
sndfile    for audio file handling I think

Packaging... alternative to JUCE I guess...

	... Suspect using this would make the song editor harder. Would probably need to add extensions etc
