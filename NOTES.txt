MIDI monitoring: use gmidimonitor  (in Ubuntu repo)


- change the URLs to my Github account


Tools
-----
lv2lint    to check plugin
valgrind   for memory issues

Libraries
---------
sndfile    for audio file handling I think


GUI requirements
----------------
- Portable - ideally to mobile etc
- Statically linkable
- Ideally LGPL, Apache, MIT, or similar

GUI Plan
--------
Initially try: 
	https://github.com/sjaehn/BWidgets
these are GPL but keep the code in a separate directory to isolate for the moment.

ANOTHER OPTION (free):
	https://github.com/DISTRHO/DPF-Widgets/tree/main

Note this contains some LGPL options:
	https://github.com/openAVproductions/openAV-AVTK

Free JS pianoroll here:
   	https://github.com/ryohey/signal/
Maybe translate it

- Look at Dragonfly reverb (uses Mesa 3D graphics library)
- Look at the LV2 pianoroll pattern plugin in Ardour plugin


NB Cairo is the 2D vector rendering library used by gtk, although
   they may be moving away from it

B.Widgets: SOME music widgets (GPL licence)   Includes piano keys, knobs, meters




"Building atoms: The LV2_Atom_Forge API allows developers to build atoms by progressively appending data to a buffer, 
which can be a memory buffer, a ring buffer, or a plugin's output port"
