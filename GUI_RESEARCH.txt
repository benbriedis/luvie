GUI_RESEARCH
============

Requirements
------------
- Portable - ideally to mobile etc
- Statically linkable
- Ideally LGPL, Apache, MIT, or similar


Statically-Linkable Widget Libraries...  is probably a good place to start
---------------------------------------
imgui 
	- designed for games, which is a similar use case
    - MIT license  (yay!)
	- apparently sophisticated architecture
	- great looking cross-platform support

	https://github.com/DISTRHO/dear-plugins
	https://gitlab.com/GroGy/im-neo-sequencer
	https://github.com/alanjfs/sequentity
	https://github.com/epezent/implot might be handy!  (MIT license!)

FLTK

Note QT has statically linkable option, but need to be paid for.
GTK is not statically linkable.
wxWidgets is probably statically linkable.



THOUGHTS
--------

- Juce - made for the purpose, but GPL or pay
       - probably just rather use LV2

- Probably best dynamically linked option: QT
   GTK and wxWidgets are alternatives but GTK very much has a Gnome focus and its OO model is a bit yuck.
   wxWidgets has no real advantage over Qt, except that it may be easier to statically link.
   Can't statically link Gtk at all. With Qt I think its theoretically possible.

- Static linking... looks painful (unless maybe using JUCE).
   - OpenGL and Vulkan can be targetted using glfw. These are both meant for more full-on graphics.
   - Could possibly combine with blend2D for vector graphics.
   - Could maybe use https://github.com/wjakob/nanogui (OpenGL) or something similar for Vulkan 
     to provide some widgets.

pianoroll examples

Cross platform event handling and window libraries 
==================================================
glfw	https://www.glfw.org/  (more minimal. Just graphics, which is all we want) 
sdl		https://www.libsdl.org/


Vulkan 2D Drawing Libraries 
===========================

libvvk  https://github.com/jeffboody/libvkk
skitty  https://github.com/lynx-family/skity
vkvg    https://github.com/jpbruyere/vkvg 

OpenGL Widgets
==============
https://github.com/wjakob/nanogui

2D Drawing Libraries
====================
A vector drawing program is probably needed if drawing pianrolls etc...

See https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39443172 for useful discussion.
cario and qt paint are pretty much in maintenance mode. skia looks difficult and maybe bloaty.

blend2D  (speed) 
	<== Looks like static linking might be ok 

https://github.com/thorvg/thorvg may be good 
  <== small memory useful 
  <== can run in TS
  <== suspect dynamic linking is more practical


small alternatives:
	Tiny Skia
	https://github.com/a-e-k/canvas_ity
	https://github.com/memononen/nanovg

Some widget Libraries
=====================
Try wxWidgets
 - How large are the binaries?
 - NOTE: because it is not used as the basis of an OS, more likely to be able to statically link and cut down.
 - Does it use/incorporate a drawing library?

Initially try: 
	https://github.com/sjaehn/BWidgets
these are GPL but keep the code in a separate directory to isolate for the moment.

ANOTHER OPTION (free):
	https://github.com/DISTRHO/DPF-Widgets/tree/main

Note this contains some LGPL options:
	https://github.com/openAVproductions/openAV-AVTK

Free JS pianoroll here:
   	https://github.com/ryohey/signal/
Maybe translate it
