3. Better Alternatives to Static Linking

Because static linking GTK is difficult, the industry standard for distributing GTK apps without relying on system libraries is to use bundling technologies: 

    AppImage (Linux): Packages all libraries inside a single executable.

    Flatpak/Snap: Ensures the app brings its own runtime.

    Windows Bundle: Simply place the necessary DLLs in the same directory as your executable. 

Summary Recommendation:

    Use FLTK for a tiny, statically linked GUI.
    Use AppImage to distribute a "static-like" GTK application
